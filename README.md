# Scheme in Go

This is a simple WatchMeCode project that aims to implement a small
subset of Scheme in Go.  I'm mainly doing this to teach myself Go.

Feel free to contribute!  If I'm doing something that's unidiomatic in
Go and there's a better way, let me know.

## TODO

Don't recurse when reading non-nested lists.

Use bignums for numbers.

Properly handle Unicode.

Don't append strings via `Sprintf` in `pr`.
